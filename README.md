# Testnet Data

This repository contains data used for bootstrapping nodes to connect to test Eximchain networks. In particular this contains:

* Genesis Blocks
* Bootnode Lists

Testnets in the quorum directory run [our fork of quorum](https://github.com/Eximchain/quorum)

## Important Disclaimers

Test networks are not intended to be permanent and tokens on them are expected and intended to have no real world value. At this time, test networks may be created or destroyed with no advance warning. Please do not use any test network to store sensitive data or data that must be persisted permanently.

By using data in this repository to connect to an Eximchain test network, you indicate that you understand the primary purpose of the test network is to facilitate development effort, and agree that you will act in good faith to not intentionally disrupt this purpose for any other users of the network.

## Contributing

We do not accept direct contributions to this repository. However, we encourage you to file an issue if you think you have found an error, or if you require additional data to connect to a test network.
